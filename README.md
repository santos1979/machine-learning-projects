---Machine Learning Projects---

Welcome to the Machine Learning Projects repository! This repository contains various projects related to machine learning that I have worked on and will continue to work on over time. 
These projects serve as a platform for me to study, experiment with, and apply different machine learning techniques and methodologies.

---Overview---
This repository contains different projects related to machine learning, each organized in its own subdirectory. Each project showcases a unique application or technique, 
including data preprocessing, model building, evaluation, and more. The goal is to provide a comprehensive collection of projects that demonstrate various aspects of machine learning.

---Repository Structure--
The repository is organized into several directories, each representing a different project. Each project may include the following directories:

- data/: Contains datasets used for the project.
- notebooks/: Contains Jupyter notebooks used for analysis, experimentation, and visualization.
- src/: Contains source code and scripts for implementing machine learning models and other functionalities.
- README.md: A project-specific README file providing details about the project, objectives, and instructions.

Future Projects
Additional projects will be added as I continue learning and experimenting with various machine learning techniques. 
These projects will cover a range of topics including, but not limited to, deep learning, natural language processing, and unsupervised learning.

---Goals---
The primary goals of this repository are:

- Experiment with different machine learning algorithms and techniques.
- Understand data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation processes.
- Gain hands-on experience with real-world datasets.
- Continuously improve and refine machine learning skills.
- To document the process and results of each project for future reference and improvement.
