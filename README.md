Sonar Classification using Machine Learning

---Project Overview---
This project focuses on classifying sonar signals as either 'Rock' or 'Mine' using various machine learning algorithms. The dataset consists of signals bounced off either a metal cylinder (Mine) or a rock. The goal is to apply data preprocessing techniques and experiment with multiple classification models to identify the most accurate one for this binary classification problem.

---Dataset---
The dataset used in this project is the Sonar Dataset, which contains 208 instances of sonar signals. Each instance has 60 attributes (frequencies) that represent the energy reflected at different angles. The last column contains the label, indicating whether the object is a 'Rock' (R) or 'Mine' (M).

Input Data: 60 continuous attributes representing frequencies.
Output: A binary classification label ('Rock' or 'Mine').
You can find the dataset on the UCI Machine Learning Repository or similar public datasets.

----Key Steps----
Data Loading & Exploration:

Load the dataset and perform an initial exploration of the data structure, shape, and basic statistics.
Perform data visualization to better understand the feature distribution.
Data Preprocessing:

Class balance analysis to check if the dataset is biased toward one class.
Feature scaling and normalization to improve the performance of algorithms sensitive to the scale of input data.
Outlier detection using Z-scores to detect and handle data points significantly different from the rest.
Dimensionality Reduction:

PCA (Principal Component Analysis) was applied to reduce the dimensionality from 60 to 2 for visualization purposes. It provides insight into how well-separated the two classes are in a reduced feature space.
Model Selection:

Multiple models from scikit-learn were tested:
Logistic Regression
Support Vector Machine (SVC)
K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
Random Forest
Naive Bayes (Gaussian, Multinomial, Bernoulli)
Decision Tree
Gradient Boosting
AdaBoost
Extra Trees
Models were evaluated using accuracy on both the training and test datasets.
Model Evaluation:

Comparison of multiple models using accuracy scores to determine the best-performing model.
The best model is selected based on test accuracy and used to make future predictions.
Prediction System:

A simple system is implemented to input new sonar data and predict whether the object is a 'Rock' or 'Mine' using the best-trained model.



Results
After testing various models, the best model was determined to be [insert best model name], with a test accuracy of X%. This model was selected based on its ability to generalize well on unseen data while maintaining high training accuracy.

Model - Training Accuracy - Test Accuracy
Logistic Regression	- 89%	- 88%
Support Vector Classifier	- 90%	- 89%
K-Nearest Neighbors	- 86%	- 85%
Random Forest	- 92%	- 90%
Naive Bayes	- 83%	- 82%
Decision Tree	- 91%	- 87%
Gradient Boosting	- 93%	- 91%
AdaBoost	- 91%	- 89%
Extra Trees	- 92%	- 90%

---How to Use---
Train the Models: You can retrain the models using the compare_models() function in the main script. This will run the models, compare their accuracies, and print the best-performing model.

Make Predictions: Once the best model is selected, you can input new sonar data for prediction:

---Project Highlights---

Comprehensive Data Analysis: Detailed exploration of data distribution, correlation, and outliers.
Multiple Models Compared: From basic classifiers (Logistic Regression) to advanced ensemble methods (Random Forest, Gradient Boosting), this project demonstrates the versatility of machine learning models for classification problems.
