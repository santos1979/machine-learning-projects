Sonar Classification using Machine Learning

---Project Overview---
This project focuses on classifying sonar signals as either 'Rock' or 'Mine' using various machine learning algorithms. The dataset consists of signals bounced off either a metal cylinder (Mine) or a rock. The goal is to apply data preprocessing techniques and experiment with multiple classification models to identify the most accurate one for this binary classification problem.

---Dataset---
The dataset used in this project is the Sonar Dataset, which contains 208 instances of sonar signals. Each instance has 60 attributes (frequencies) that represent the energy reflected at different angles. The last column contains the label, indicating whether the object is a 'Rock' (R) or 'Mine' (M).

Input Data: 60 continuous attributes representing frequencies.
Output: A binary classification label ('Rock' or 'Mine').
You can find the dataset on the UCI Machine Learning Repository or similar public datasets.

---Key Steps---
1. Data Loading & Exploration:
Load the dataset and perform an initial exploration of the data structure, shape, and basic statistics.
Data visualization to better understand the feature distribution and class separability.
2. Data Preprocessing:
Class balance analysis: Evaluating if the dataset is biased toward one class.
Feature scaling and normalization: Scaling the data using StandardScaler was considered based on the type of models used, such as KNN and Naive Bayes, which are sensitive to feature magnitudes.
Data Augmentation: Synthetic data generation techniques were applied to balance the dataset and improve model generalization.
Outlier detection using Z-scores to detect and handle data points significantly different from the rest.
3. Dimensionality Reduction:
PCA (Principal Component Analysis): Applied to reduce the dimensionality from 60 to 2 for visualization purposes. It provides insight into how well-separated the two classes are in a reduced feature space.
4. Model Selection:
Multiple models from scikit-learn were tested, with and without scaling and data augmentation:

Logistic Regression
Support Vector Machine (SVC)
K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
Random Forest
Naive Bayes (Gaussian, Multinomial, Bernoulli)
Decision Tree
Gradient Boosting
AdaBoost
Extra Trees
5. Model Evaluation:
Models were evaluated using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score on both the training and test datasets.
Cross-Validation: Used to ensure the robustness of models and prevent overfitting.
The performance was compared before and after applying data augmentation and scaling.

---Results---
After testing various models, the best model was determined to be Support Vector Classifier (SVC), with a test accuracy of 98.08%. Data augmentation improved the performance of several models, while scaling had a positive impact on specific algorithms such as KNN and Naive Bayes.

Final Model Results (After Data Augmentation):
Model	Cross-Validation Accuracy	Test Accuracy	Precision	Recall	F1-Score
Logistic Regression	0.8142	0.8558	0.8696	0.8163	0.8421
SVC	0.9550	0.9808	1.0	0.9592	0.9792
K-Nearest Neighbors	0.8301	0.8365	0.9000	0.7347	0.8090
Random Forest	0.9425	0.9519	0.9783	0.9184	0.9474
Gradient Boosting	0.9329	0.9519	0.9783	0.9184	0.9474
AdaBoost	0.9136	0.9519	0.9583	0.9388	0.9485
Extra Trees	0.9680	0.9712	1.0	0.9388	0.9684

Key Observations:
Support Vector Classifier (SVC) consistently showed the highest test accuracy (98.08%), even after data augmentation.
Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, and Extra Trees also performed exceptionally well with high accuracy and F1-scores.
KNN and Naive Bayes benefited significantly from scaling, improving their ability to handle differences in feature magnitudes.

---How to Use---
Train the Models: You can retrain the models using the compare_models() function in the main script. This will run the models, compare their accuracies, and print the best-performing model.

Make Predictions: Once the best model is selected, you can input new sonar data for prediction:
